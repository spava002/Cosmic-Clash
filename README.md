# Cosmic-Clash

Join the fight in Cosmic Clash to fend off the invaders from Celestria! Do you have what it takes to save your home land?

This project serves as a checkpoint of my learning from the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D" Udemy course. Cosmic Clash uses the mini project built in that course and builds upon it immensely by adding a large amount of creativity and original content to form its own separate game. This game is near completion, so a expect a few more up-to-date versions to be released after this one.
